An aeropress makes a single 8oz cup of coffee, using air pressure to extract extra flavor out of the coffee grounds. An aeropress is a small aparatus made out of plastic, using a large plunger to create pressure and push the coffee and hot water solution through the filter. We offer aeropress coffees at Code Cafe, but you can also buy an aeropress in store to try at home for yourself!

So once you bring home your new aeropress, how do you use it?

1. Add your grounds to the aeropress, using the scoop provided. 

2. Boil some water using a kettle.

3. Pour just enough boiling water into the aeropress to cover the grounds. 

4. Stir the grounds and water solution for about 30 seconds.

5. Fill to the top of the press with boiling water.

6. Secure the filter.

7. Flip aeropress upside down and place on coffee cup, so filter is facing into the cup.

8. Press down the plunger until your cup is filled with coffee.

9. Enjoy!
