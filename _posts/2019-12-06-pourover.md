Recently we have had some questions from customers about pour-overs. What makes them special? How should you drink them?

Pour-overs are made with extra attention to detail, in order to extract the most flavour. The coffee grounds and water are weighed out and the water is boiled to a specific temperature. The water is added gradually to the grounds over 4 minutes. If you've done this correctly the grounds should end up in dome shape in the filter. 

The intention is to drink a pour-over black. This way you get to experience all of the notes and flavours the coffee has to offer, without changing the flavor with sugar and cream. 

Pour-overs take a little extra time to make, but the result is worth the wait!
